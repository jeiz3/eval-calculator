# eval-calculator

A calculator is a device that operates by interpreting the numbers and mathematical operators you input through its buttons. 

In this project, the objective is to create a simple calculator capable of performing basic arithmetic operations between : addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The chosen method for achieving this is through the use of JavaScript's 'eval()' function. It's important to note that 'eval()' is generally discouraged due to security risks associated with its execution. However, for the specific purpose of this project, using 'eval()' is deemed acceptable as it serves purely for educational and learning purposes.
